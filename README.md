# Sample Application #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

We are using Apache Camel and Spring Boot, each has different context path respectively sampleservice and storefront.  We cannot remove any of this, since it has unique needs. **

Swagger api-docs is generated by Swagger(springfox) dependencies, we will only define the endpoints.

### The problem facing ###
URL - http://localhost:8080/sampleservices/swagger-ui.html
This application is having one api (http://localhost:8080/sampleservices/storefront/ping). Basically /sampleservices/storefront acts as the basepath , but I need to remove the word "storefront" from it. But I am unable to do so. Since based on the "storefront" word only api-docs getting generated.
